# Wiper_System_Application

This repository contains a versatile wiper system application with four operational modes: Off, Auto, High, and Low. These modes control the velocity of the wiper blades to suit different weather conditions. Here's a brief overview of each mode:

## Off Mode
In this mode, the wipers are completely deactivated, and the wiper speed is set to 0.

## Auto Mode
The wiper system operates automatically in response to rain. The wiper speed varies based on the intensity of the rain. The wiper speeds corresponding to different rain intensities are as follows:
- Rain Intensity 0: Wiper Speed 0
- Rain Intensity 1: Wiper Speed 40
- Rain Intensity 2: Wiper Speed 45
- Rain Intensity 3: Wiper Speed 50
- Rain Intensity 4: Wiper Speed 55
- Rain Intensity 5: Wiper Speed 60
- Rain Intensity 6: Wiper Speed 65
- Rain Intensity 7: Wiper Speed 70

## Medium Mode
In this mode, the wiper speed is set to a constant value of 40, regardless of the weather conditions.

## High Mode
This mode sets the wiper speed to a constant value of 70, providing maximum cleaning capability for heavy rain or debris.
